/* host_sim_main.c -- host-side stand-in for the STM32 firmware loop.
 *
 * Reads PilInputPacket structs from stdin, runs pil_core_step() (the
 * exact same logic that will run on the Nucleo), writes
 * PilOutputPacket structs to stdout. This lets the full wire protocol
 * and PC-side driver be verified end-to-end on a normal Linux box
 * before any hardware is involved -- the STM32 firmware (Phase 4b)
 * differs from this file only in how bytes get in and out (UART
 * interrupt/DMA instead of stdin/stdout) and in using the DWT cycle
 * counter instead of clock() for timing.
 *
 * Usage: host_sim < packets_in.bin > packets_out.bin
 * or, as used by python/scripts/pil_driver.py, as a long-running
 * subprocess communicating over its stdin/stdout pipes.
